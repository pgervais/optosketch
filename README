This is the sources for Optosketch, a free editor for optical schematics with a stylus-based interface.

The main window interface is designed using qt-designer (mainwindow.ui). To generate the corresponding python file, just type make (is just invokes pyuic4).

Optosketch can be launched from inside the sources with 'python optosketch.py'.
It requires Qt4 python bindings (pyside may be used in the future) and numpy.
